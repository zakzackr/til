## Generics
1. Code Reusability    
After writing a class, interface, and method once, we can use it for any data type.  
e.g. Once we define Stack\<E>, Stack can hold data types such as Integer... by creating an instance of Stack\<Integer>.
    
2. Type Safety  
A Java compiler applies strong type checking to generic code and raises errors if the code violates type safety. Fixing compile-time errors is easier than fixing runtime errors.
