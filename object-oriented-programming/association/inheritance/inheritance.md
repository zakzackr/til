## Inheritance (IS-A relationship)
Inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. To be more precise, a subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods) from its superclass. Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass by using super().

### IS-A relationship (parent-child relationship)
When Person class inherits from Animal class, Person IS-A Animal.
