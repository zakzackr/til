## Aggregation (HAS-A relationship)
Aggregation is a special type of association and is a directional (one way) association. Aggregation represents HAS-A relationship, which means "A Person HAS-A Wallet".  
  
The lifecycles of the objects (Person and Wallet objects) arenâ€™t tied. It means every one of them can exist independently of each other. For example, if a person drops his/her wallet, the wallet can still exist. Another person can own the dropped wallet.  
Association > Aggregation(does not involve owning) > Composition(involves owning)
